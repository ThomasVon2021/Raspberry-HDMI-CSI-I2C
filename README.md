> Convert HDMI signal acquisition into CSI signal and I2C audio signal
## Introduction
Raspberry pi is a very popular device in the open source world.In many application scenarios, we need to collect the video and audio of HDMI input device.At present, there are some modules on the market that can convert HDMI signal to CSI signal.But either they can't convert video and sudio at the same time, or they are very expensive, or they are not easy to install on raspberry pi.Therefore, I made a module that can convert HDMI signals into video and audio signals at the same time, and it is not expensive. I named it C780.
