> Convert HDMI signal acquisition into CSI signal and I2S audio signal
## Introduction
Raspberry pi is a very popular device in the open source world.In many application scenarios, we need to collect the video and audio of HDMI input device.At present, there are some modules in the market that can convert HDMI signal to CSI signal rather than video and audio signal separately at the same time.Besides they are very expensive, and not easy to install on raspberry pi.Therefore, I design a module that can convert HDMI signals to video and audio signals separately at the same time, the most important is, it is not expensive. Its name is **C780**.

## Version
C780 module is divided into C780A and C780B versions according to the number of CSI-2 channels.C780A supports 2 CSI-2 channels, up to 1080P50fps HDMI input.And C780B supports 4 CSI-2 channels, up to 1080P60fps HDMI input.
